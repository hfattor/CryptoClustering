# CryptoClustering
Cryptocurrency data about 41 different currencies is scaled using the scikit-learn `StandardScaler` module, then examined using the K-means algorithm. The scaled data is also examined using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) methods to determine the best value for k. Both results are examined and analyzed in the Jupyter Notebook file.
